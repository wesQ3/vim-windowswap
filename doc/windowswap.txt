1. ABOUT WINDOWSWAP ~
                                                             *windowswap-about*

WindowSwap helps you swap your buffers between existing split windows without
affecting your current split layout.

Vim's window movement commands work fine when you only have a few splits open
or want to push a window over to an edge. But what happens when you have a
complicated layout and you just want to swap a couple arbitrary windows? That
is where WindowSwap can help out.

My thanks to `sgriffin` on stackoverflow.com who helped me out when I was just
a vim newbie in need of some window-shuffle incantations. His anwser formed
the core of WindowSwap (and remains so, currently). Give the man your upvote,
folks. The SO question where this little plugin started is here:

2. QUICK START ~
                                                        *windowswap-quickstart*

If all you need to do is swap some windows around, usage is pretty simple:

1. Navigate to the window you'd like to move
2. Press `<leader>ww` to mark that window for a future swap
3. Navigate to the window you'd like to swap with
4. Press `<leader>ww` again to swap the marked window with the current one

That's it!

3. KEY MAPPINGS ~
                                  *windowswap-keymappings* *windowswap-functions*

First of all, you can prevent these default bindings by setting
`g:windowswap_map_keys` to `0` in your `.vimrc`.

*WindowSwap#EasyWindowSwap*                           `<leader>ww`
Mark current window if none is marked, swap current window with marked window
if mark is currently set. Clears marked window flag after swapping.

*WindowSwap#MarkWindowSwap*                           `<leader>yw`
Mark current window to be swapped. If the mark is already set to another
window, update the mark to the new window.
Note: This default mapping is deprecated. You'll have to put it in your .vimrc
yourself if you want it to keep working in the future:
>
 nnoremap <silent> <leader>yw :call WindowSwap#MarkWindowSwap()<CR>
<

*WindowSwap#DoWindowSwap*                             `<leader>pw`
Swap marked window with currently active window. If no mark is set, the user
is chastised accordingly.
Note: This default mapping is deprecated. You'll have to put it in your .vimrc
yourself if you want it to keep working in the future:
>
 nnoremap <silent> <leader>pw :call WindowSwap#DoWindowSwap()<CR>
<

*g:windowswap_map_keys*                               default: `1`
Allow WindowSwap to map its default keys. Set to `0` to prevent any key
mappings.

*g:windowswap_mapping_deprecation_notice*             default: `0`
Allow deprecation notices upon using deprecated default bindings.
